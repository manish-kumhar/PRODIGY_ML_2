# **Retail Customer Segmentation**
## **Overview**
Retail Customer Segmentation is a project aimed at helping retailers better understand their customer base by segmenting them into distinct groups based on their purchase behavior. By leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly K-means clustering, this project provides insights into customer segments, enabling retailers to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project contains comprehensive information about retail customers, including demographics (such as age, education, marital status), purchase history (amount spent on various product categories), and responses to marketing campaigns.

## **Approach**
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected based on their potential impact on customer segmentation.
Model Building: K-means clustering algorithm is applied to segment customers into distinct groups.
Interpretation: The resulting customer segments are analyzed to derive actionable insights, such as identifying high-value customers, understanding purchasing preferences, and assessing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
